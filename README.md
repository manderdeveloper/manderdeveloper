### Hi there 👋

## About Me

👋 Hello! I'm a passionate backend and DevOps developer with experience in building technology solutions. My goal is to create robust and efficient applications while ensuring a smooth and reliable development and deployment process.

In the backend realm, I have experience working with various programming languages and frameworks such as JavaScript/Node.js, Python, and Java. I love tackling technical challenges and finding elegant solutions to complex problems.

In the DevOps domain, I enjoy working with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins to build CI/CD pipelines and automate application deployments. I believe in close collaboration between development and operations teams to achieve a seamless and efficient development lifecycle.

## Personal Interests

In my free time, I have a range of personal interests that help me stay balanced and creative:

- ☕️ **Coffee**: I'm a coffee lover and enjoy the variety of flavors and aromas this delightful beverage offers. I relish trying different types of coffee and experimenting with brewing methods.
